### Description

Here is the simple mechanism of authorization created for showing my skills in working with server. If it's rather well, it can be used as authorization mechanics template with access token.

I used JavaSript here because I don't see reasons for writing any types here. Yup was used for registration form validation and axios - for requests. Also I check data on backend server and use custom messages for explanation a problem for person. After successfull registration you need to sign in. If login comes successfully, I get token from server and put it in localStorage for using it in future for getting any data for user.

### Installing

You need to use `git clone` command and then write this commands for both of two folders:

    npm install

The same command is:

    npm i

After installing all dependencies start project with this command for each folder:

    npm start

On MongoDB server I added public IP success, that means that you can successfully start this server on any computer and have access to collection with users. I hope it works.
